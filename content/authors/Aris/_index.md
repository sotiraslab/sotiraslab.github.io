I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Radiology](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/), [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), affiliated with the [Informatics, Data Science & Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu/). My research is in the area of medical image analysis and machine learning, with applications to brain development and aging. I focus on developing novel computational methods to extract information from imaging data and delineate patterns in large heterogeneous data sets, towards improving patient-specific diagnosis and advancing our understanding of brain structure and function in health and disease.

Before joining WashU, I was a Research Associate at the Section of Biomedical Image Analysis, University of Pennsylvania, working with [Prof. Christos Davatzikos](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g334/p32990) on unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques to analyze high-dimensional heterogeneous neuroimaging data.

I did my PhD in the Center of Visual Computing at Ecole Centrale Paris, under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7edhlaQAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I developed novel deformable image registration methods based on discrete optimization and probabilistic graphical models.

Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (ECE-NTUA).
