Soumyendu Sekhar “Sam” Ghosh is a PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering. His current research focuses on modelling brain tumor growth trajectories using physics informed machine learning. The overarching goal of his research is to help create predictive Digital Twin to aid tumor management protocols and clinical decision-making. Previously, he has also worked on unsupervised anomaly detection methods for quality control of head CT scans. Sam received his bachelor’s and master’s degree, both in Electrical Engineering, from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. 
In his free time, Sam likes to watch cerebral action dramas, soothing cooking videos and standup.
