        The Sotiras Lab, also known as the Medical Imaging & Data Science (MINDS) Lab, is focused on developing novel computational methods to extract information from imaging data and delineate patterns in large heterogeneous data sets. Our goal is to improve patient-specific diagnosis and advance our understanding of brain structure and function in health and disease.
